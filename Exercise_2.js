//Write a simple JavaScript program to find the average of an array of integers.
//Use the array below:

var arr = [11, 45, 5, 69, 44, 20, 49, 21, 9, 14, 18, 47, 7, 87, 92, 88, 63, 93, 6, 57, 53, 55, 1, 72, 22, 39, 81, 76, 67, 40, 15, 52, 96, 36, 94, 65, 70, 61, 8, 75, 17, 83, 85, 78, 97, 28, 43, 16, 13, 50, 91, 25, 26, 90, 30, 60, 51, 0, 58, 98, 80, 74, 37, 71, 19, 29, 33, 84, 48, 95, 46, 32, 73, 89, 42, 68, 99, 24, 34, 35, 86, 38, 64, 79, 77, 23, 56, 41, 2, 54, 4, 59, 31, 10, 27, 3, 82, 12, 66, 62];
var counter = 0;
var sum = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
{
    sum = arr[i];
    counter++;
}
var avg = sum / counter;
console.log(avg); //0.62
